             <h2>January</h2>
       <ul>
             <li>This Month I Read "Ready Player One" by Ernest Cline.
             Ready Player One is a book set in 2044, A dystopian Sci-fi version of reality. In the U.S. at 2044, the world is falling
             apart at the seams as countries battle for the very few remaining natural rescources, nearly 84% of citizens live in 
             poverty or The Stacks, and the OASIS is the only place with a functioning currency system. The Stacks are some genius'
             solution to the lack of land for people to live, resulting in skyscraper-tall stacks of old trailers, with people 
             living in. The stacks cause tons of deaths from collapses due to poor structure, drug accidents, and idiocracy. In this
             terrible world, the OASIS is the only place people can go to enjoy life. The OASIS, made by Gregarious Simulation 
             Systems, Is a compact virtual reality visor with a full-on body suit to control your OASIS avatar. The entire story takes 
             place in this new reality. When the lead coder of GSS and Creator of Oasis, James Halliday, Dies and leaves a stange 
             will, The entire OASIS world goes manic. In his will, Halliday left the entire OASIS system and GSS to whoever can find 
             an Egg hidden somewhere in the OASIS, and with his will he leaves a scoreboard which shows the avatar who has gotten 
             through the most gates and is closer to the egg. When Wade Watts, the main character, has his avatar name (Parzival) is
             the first to make it through the first '80s themed gate, the entire world explodes, and the book kicks off following
             parzival through the challenges of being so close to success yet so far, and dealing with the death threats and fans 
             of fame.</li>

             <h2>December</h2>
       <ul>
             <li>This Month I read Speak. Speak is a book about Over the summer, Melinda Sordino calls the police at the end of
             the summer for a reason she refuses to reveal. We follow her through the next school year and slowly see the details 
             reveal themselves, the struggle of dealing with such a secret, and how melinda deals with the other people related 
             to the issue. This is a very good book, but I would reccomend it for a young adult audience and not children.</li>

             <h2>November</h2>
         <ul>
             <li>Book blog-  For my nonfiction required reading i read <i>"The science of batman"</i> A book about how and if batman's gear, vehicles, and skills would work in the real world. In
             this book they analyze real world science and seemingly magical items in the real world that batman uses as something that "doesn't exist" irl.   
             I'd rate this book a 5/5 because i love to see how science has extended to make things real that were fake when the original batman comic books were released. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves science and superheroes.</li>
