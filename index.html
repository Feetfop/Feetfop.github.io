             <h2>December</h2>
         <ul>
             <li>This Month I read Speak. Speak is a book about Over the summer, Melinda Sordino calls the police at the end of the summer for a reason she refuses to reveal. We follow her through the next school year and slowly see the details reveal themselves, the struggle of dealing with such a secret, and how melinda deals with the other people related to the issue. This is a very good book, but I would reccomend it for a young adult audience and not children.</li>

             <h2>November</h2>
         <ul>
             <li>Book blog-  For my nonfiction required reading i read <i>"The science of batman"</i> A book about how and if batman's gear, vehicles, and skills would work in the real world. In
             this book they analyze real world science and seemingly magical items in the real world that batman uses as something that "doesn't exist" irl.   
             I'd rate this book a 5/5 because i love to see how science has extended to make things real that were fake when the original batman comic books were released. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves science and superheroes.</li>
